											<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Downtime and repairs to crushers, grinders, shredders, conveyor belts and other processing equipment due to damage by tramp metal are costly. That's why concerned plant managers and engineers consider tramp metal detectors an essential addition to their conveyor lines. They also have discovered that detectors are not created equal and important features should be weighed before making a purchasing decision.</font></p>
											<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Weigh all the features, and you'll agree SciTronics Tramp Metal Detectors are the best value. They blend state-of-the art technology with practical application features developed over many years of working closely with conveyor users. With two models plus many options available, there's a system to meet your specific use requirements.</font></p>
											<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Offering both Single and Dual Coil Models, Scitronics Tramp Metal Detectors, equipped with solid-state ICs, are specifically designed for easy set up and use, reliable operation, trouble-free service, and long lived durability.</font></p>
											<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Applications include use with standard or steel cored conveyor belts transporting aggregates, coal, rubber, iron pellets, wood chips, tar sands, sinter, iron, nickel, aluminum, and molybdenum ores.</font></p>
