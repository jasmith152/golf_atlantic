    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Stan Moore, President of Gulf Atlantic Industrial Equipment Inc., grew up in the construction industry across the state of Florida.  Since that time, he has expanded his work experience to include projects across the entire southeastern U.S., the Caribbean, Colorado, Ohio, Arizona, and California.</p>

    <p>You name the project and Stan and his family were probably there or working at a job site nearby - Alligator Alley, Lake Okeechobee Levee Construction, Cross Florida Barge Canal, site construction at Florida Power Coal Plants 1 & 2 and the Florida Power Nuclear Plant, Kissimmee River Canal Projects, the construction of the Tampa Fairgrounds, managed one of the first companies to mix fly ash and cement for road base projects in Citrus County, Florida, mining rock, providing equipment for mining, road, and bridge construction, countless concrete plant sales and installation projects from concept to startup and beyond, and much more.</p>
    <p>From driving the haul trucks and working on a survey crew, to operating loaders and dozers, to running a dragline, to dynamite blasting in rock mines, to job supervision, heavy equipment sales, and finally, in 1995, to owning his own industrial equipment and construction company, Stan has learned the equipment and construction industries from the bottom up.  It wasn't easy, but it sure was effective.</p>
    <p>Stan learned what kind of equipment was needed to get a job done right and he learned the all important art of problem solving by immersing himself at job sites alongside his customers until projects were satisfactorily completed.   As a teenager working summers with the Army Corp of Engineers, he learned to read plans, calculate yardage and shoot elevations - skills that became invaluable when assisting customers with site layout and design in later years.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/about-us-photos.jpg" width="712" height="106" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Whether at a concrete batch plant, a rock or sand mine, a dolomite plant, a power plant, a port facility, or even a potato chip factory, Stan never stopped learning about the equipment required for a job and how it could best be put to use.  From metal detectors and vibratory equipment, to belt scales, conveyors and crushing equipment, to concrete batch plants and site layout, Stan's product and application knowledge has steadily grown for decades - making both Stan and Gulf-Atlantic very valuable assets to their customers.</p>
    <p>Stan and Gulf-Atlantic have recommended and supplied: the concrete plants for the construction of the Atlantis Hotel complex at Paradise Island, Bahamas,  the crushing equipment for CEMEX mines in Inglis and Fort Myers, the rail car unloading facility at Orlando Utilities, the concrete plants for the construction of the largest new steel mill in the U.S. near Mobile, Alabama, countless custom fabrication and equipment replacement projects, and much more.</p>
    <p>That is the kind of hard earned knowledge and practical application experience you will find at the core of the company philosophy at Gulf-Atlantic Industrial Equipment.</p>
    <p>Stan and the staff at Gulf-Atlantic are committed to getting the job done right and they don't stop until they achieve that goal.  Customer satisfaction and the resulting years of customer loyalty is not just a goal at Gulf-Atlantic, it is the bedrock that forms the foundation of our company.</p>
