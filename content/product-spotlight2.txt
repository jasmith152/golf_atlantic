<p><font size="2">The 3D Level Scanner is the newest family of devices that takes the guesswork out of measuring the level, volume, and mass of materials inside a silo or open bin.&nbsp;The 3D Level Scanner is a non-contact device that works in environments where other technologies like radar and ultrasonic&rsquo;s fail to create a visual map of the material surface in storage and process bins.&nbsp;</font><font size="2"><u>HOW DOES IT WORK? </u></font><font size="2">The 3D Level Scanner employs a 2-dimensional array beam-former to send low frequency pulses and receive echoes to a Digital Signal Processor that analyses the data and generates a 3-dimensional image of the surface that can be displayed on a remote screen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The 3DLevelScanner can work in small to very large bins and can measure up to 200&rsquo; tall and 150&rsquo; wide. It is versatile and can accommodate a wide variety of vessels or containers including open bins, bulk storage rooms and warehouses. The 3DLevelScanner is offered in three models &ndash;&lsquo;S&rsquo; for single point level measurement, &lsquo;M&rsquo; which adds mapping capabilities, and &lsquo;MV&rsquo; with both mapping and visualization graphics tools &ndash; for flexibility for any application and budget.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Suited for most powder or bulk solid material, it is proven to perform in coal, cement, aggregates, flyash, chemicals, fertilizers, food, grain, plastic pellets and powders. Any industry requiring accurate, non-contact measurement technology will benefit including feed, grain and seed; cement, aggregates and concrete; fertilizer; milling and food manufacturing; biofuels and ethanol; chemicals and pharmaceuticals; plastics manufacturing; power; mining and quarries; paper and wood pulp; primary metals and power.</font></font></p>
